f_about: >-
  My work and life have taught me some valuable lessons, but perhaps the most
  important one is that no matter what stage you’re at, it’s always worth
  learning new skills and improving upon them. This is what has kept me going,
  and I hope to help others by mentoring and sharing my experiences to build a
  better future for all.

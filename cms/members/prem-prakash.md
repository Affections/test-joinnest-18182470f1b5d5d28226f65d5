  "I’m a senior yoga teacher and therapist at Vyasa Yoga School, Singapore and I
  regularly conduct public programs in the area of wellness. Some of the
  programs conducted are Science of Wellness, Holistic Wellness, Mind Wellness,
  Prevention & Mitigation of Life-style Diseases, Holistic Yoga & Science of
  Pranayam, Dental Care and Eye Care. I’m a firm believer and passionate
  practitioner of Yoga Science based on Patanjali Yoga Sutra and present
  scientific explanations about the same in my workshops. I've been in the field
  of Yoga & Wellness for the last 12 years and am a certified yoga instructor
  and yoga therapist from Svyasa Yoga University, Bangalore, India. Alongside,
  I’m a gold medallist in engineering from Delhi University (DCE) and completed
  my MBA (PT) from FMS. I'm also a qualified Cost & Management accountant from
  ICMA, India and a certified Project Management Professional from PMI-USA. I’ve
  worked with and held senior and top management positions in organisations like
  Escorts, EIL, TCS in India and CK Tang, Computer Associates, Vmoksha, iFlex,
  Retive and Inventrik, Singapore, in the fields of engineering design,
  management consulting, software consulting, solutions, development &
  maintenance for the last 46 years. Currently I'm the CEO of Inventrik Pte
  Ltd., Singapore. On account of extensive travelling I've had several
  opportunities of interacting with and leading multi-racial and multinational
  teams including Indians, Chinese, Japanese, Australians, New-Zealanders,
  Arabians, Europeans and Americans. This enabled me to learn differing social
  and cultural aspects of human motivation and performance."

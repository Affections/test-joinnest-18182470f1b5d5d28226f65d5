f_about: >-
  I enable my clients to show up as the best versions of themselves; the
  versions they always knew they were. I am passionate about enabling leaders to
  win through the noise, embody their strengths and authentically shine. I
  embody my tagline of Inner Sense with Kavita by empowering my clients to make
  sense of their inner worlds, thus enabling them to lead from within.  


  I am a certified coach, an author, a podcast host, and a consultant. I have to
  combine fourteen years of vast corporate experience in executive coaching and
  organizational development, with my love for helping leaders find success and
  harmony in everyday life. I not only help my clients shine the spotlight on
  their leadership but also ensure that trickles down to their teams in ways
  that enable the entire team to shine. I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology
  and a Master's degree in Business Administration (Organizational Development),
  alongside numerous certifications in group work, life coaching and behavior
  analysis.  


  I am a published author (The Rise of SEE-19™ Leadership: See Beyond and Become
  the Leader You are Born to Be, 2021) and an inspirational speaker on
  wellbeing, self-leadership and inner sense. I also host a bi-weekly podcast,
  Inner Sense with Kavita, to inspire you to make sense of your inner world, so
  you can live consciously and be well.
